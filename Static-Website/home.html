                        Bigger Cities To Pursue Their Dreams. Since My Early Childhood,
                        I Have Had Many Aspirations And Wanted To Make It Big In Life And Have My Own Identity.
                        Being From A Small Place Like Gorakhpur Always Kept Me Away From
                        All The Exposure The City Life Has To Offer.
                        I Came Across The Yaari Advertisement While I Was Scrolling Through
                        Some Videos On YouTube And Got Fascinated To Know More.
                        I Am Now A Seasoned Reseller With Yaari With A Wide And Diverse Customer Base From Across India.
                        I Am Grateful To Yaari For Opening Up Avenues For Girls Like Me To Stay Connected With The
                        Mainstream World.”
